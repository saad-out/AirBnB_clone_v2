It is just a 10 min drive from downtown Phoenix and old town Scottsdale. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location, the coziness, and the amenities provided. The apartment is furnished with a simple elegance and is great to relax in after a long day of exploring the valley. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers, and anything in between.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is a spacious 1 bedroom/studio with a minimalist/elegant style.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You will have access to every part of the apt but I do have my personal belongings in the closet across from the bathroom. Please respect my things and this area. The complex itself has laundry onsite which I would be willing to help you access for a fee.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I will be often available after 5pm on weekdays and all day on the weekend. I live on the floor below in the same building.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The neighborh</DIV>

Please read directions/details and be aware that rain or inclement weather may make travel to/from the ranch more difficult.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It&#39;s on a working ranch, there are cows and workers! We do not have someone to specifically meet cabin guests, so it is a serve-yourself setup. We are available by phone if needed.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You have the whole cabin to yourself. Feel free to walk around areas around the cabin, and it&#39;s especially lovely to walk down the river bed when it is dry (which is most of the time).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You&#39;re on your own, we&#39;ll tell you where the key is...&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The nearest towns are Dudleyville and Winkelman, several miles north of the ranch.

					<DIV class="description">Old 1937 brick home minutes from downtown Peoria and major hospitals, the zoo and major parks / waterfront. Private room on the second floor available with shared rest of the house. The entire city is within 15 mins by car so a trip to the mall, tourist spots, major business centers or the freeway for a trip out of town is a breeze. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;House is located two blocks from a major bus route. Ubers and taxis are also very easy to call.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Parking is on street in front of the house. There is a street light at the corner and I usually leave the front porch light on so your car will be fairly lit. As with any street parking I do not recommend you leave valuables in the car. If you are traveling with a lot of stuff I will switch with you and have you park in a locked garage. I can also do that if you are not comfortable with street parking. Just let me know.</DIV>
